# Summary:
#
# If you save articles from web pages as PDF files and use the title 
# of the article as the PDF file name, you will probably end up with
# various punctuation marks in your file name which are incompatible
# or undesirable for any given Operating System (i.e. Unix, Linux,
# Microsoft, Apple, Android).
#
# Such file names derived from article titles often will contain
# punctuation marks such as "?", "!", "/", "&", "%".
#
# This script was written to enforce some of the file naming conventions
# to ensure inter-Operating System compatibility.
